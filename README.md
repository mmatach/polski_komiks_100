# Polish comic scene on a 100th Anniversary (work in progress)
*Polska scena komiksowa na 100-lecie*


First comic in Poland was published in 1919. I was interested in how polish comic scene looks right now. How many women are there? How many people actually? 

<br>I've counted only things published on paper (so no internet comics). Also no single illustrations, no covers. Everything was counted 'manually', not with any website-crawler.
<br>I'm not able to count everything because some things weren't catalogued. Data before 1990 definitely aren't complete, some old(er) newspaper/magazine comics are not included due to lack of data.
<br>Titles published in Świat Młodych are counted as a whole chapters, not how they were published (by 2-3 pages from the chapter in each number of magazine).

I was using below sources:

<br>wikipedia

<br>information from authors

Solved, somehow, problem with pre-second war authors. They mostly published in daily and weekly magazines and data is... well, there's no neat database, so:
<br>1.If I caouldn't tell exact/aprox. number of issues with published comics, title was counted as '1' in one year.
<br>2.Weekly drawings for Ha-Ga's cartoons are counted as '50' because according to Wikipedia she published two drawings in each of weekly edition of a magazine.
<br>3.Struzik Franciszek's comic really had over 2000+ issues. It was a daily comic. Yes, just one title.
<br>4.Christa Janusz was very prolific author of newspaper comics, later he moved into album format.
<br>5.Walentynowicz Marian also published in newspapers.
<br>6.Dates can also be aprox. so sometimes I evenly distributed number of comics throughout whole period in which magazine/paper existed or that comic was printed.
<br>Data based on:
