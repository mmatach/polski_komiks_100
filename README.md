# Polish comic scene on a 100th Anniversary (work in progress)
*Polska scena komiksowa na 100-lecie*

First comic in Poland was published in 1919. I was interested in how polish comic scene looks right now. How many women are there? How many people actually? To answer these questions I had to collect data by myself from the below sources - manually, not with any website-crawler - because I was combining data from two main databases with additional sources. Also I wanted to do quality check at the same time. It took me months to do this because there are over 3000+ people. I used:
<br>http://alejakomiksu.com/autorzy/A/
<br>https://www.komiks.gildia.pl/tworcy/
<br>Wikipedia
<br>https://gindi.pl/
<br>Magazyn Pismo
<br>https://www.jpf.com.pl/
<br>information from authors (I showed the file on the women-only comic group to fill the gaps)

<br>I've counted only things published on paper (so no internet comics). Also no single illustrations, no covers.
<br>Titles published in Świat Młodych were counted as a whole chapters, not how they were initially published (by 2-3 pages from the chapter in each number of magazine), because they were parts of something bigger, not standalone stories.

<br>Pre-second war authors mostly published comic strips/cartoons in daily and weekly magazines and data are... well, there's no neat database, so I developed a system which isn't perfect because each comic strip is counted as '1' (like a whole album) but that's the price. Data were based on:
<br>http://www.tytusdezoo.com.pl/xhtml/komiks/komiks.html
<br>"Dawny komiks polski" reprint series from Wydawnictwo Komiksowe
<br>Wikipedia
<br>My system:
<br>1.If I couldn't tell exact/aprox. number of issues with published comics, title was counted as '1' in one year.
<br>2.Weekly drawings for Ha-Ga's cartoons are counted as '50' because according to Wikipedia she published two drawings in each of weekly edition of a magazine.
<br>3.Sometimes dates were givex as aprox. so in such cases I evenly distributed number of comics throughout whole period in which magazine/newspaper existed or comic was printed.

<br>*Is that number an error?' section*
<br>1.Struzik Franciszek's comic really had over 2000+ issues. It was a daily comic. Yes, just one title.
<br>2.Christa Janusz was very prolific author of newspaper comics, later he moved into album format.
<br>3.Walentynowicz Marian also published in newspapers.
