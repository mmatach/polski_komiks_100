# Polish comic scene on a 100th Anniversary
*Polska scena komiksowa na 100-lecie*

*WHY & WHO?*
<br>I love comics since I was a child and my mom bought me a 'Mickey Mouse' magazine. I was interested in how polish comic scene looks right now. How many women are there? How many people actually? To answer these questions I had to collect data by myself from the below sources - manually - because I was combining data from two main databases with additional sources. and do quality check at the same time. It took me SOME time. I hope you will find effects interesting.

*SOURCES*
<br>There is no complete database so I've made one by myself based on below sources:
- Aleja Komiksu http://alejakomiksu.com/autorzy/A/ (main database)
- Gildia https://www.komiks.gildia.pl/tworcy/ (second database)
- Wikipedia
- Magazyn Pismo https://magazynpismo.pl/
- Wydawnictwo JPF https://www.jpf.com.pl/
- Sklep Gindi https://gindi.pl/
- information from authors (I showed the file on the women-only comic group to fill in the gaps)
<br>For pre-Second World War authors:
- http://www.tytusdezoo.com.pl/xhtml/komiks/komiks.html
- "Dawny komiks polski" reprint series from Wydawnictwo Komiksowe
- Wikipedia

*METHODOLOGY*
<br>I counted only things published on paper (no internet comics). Also no single illustrations, no covers. Titles published in 'Świat Młodych' were counted as a whole chapters, not how they were initially published (by 2-3 pages from the chapter in each number of magazine), because they were parts of something bigger, not standalone stories.

Pre-Second World War authors mostly published comic strips/cartoons in daily and weekly magazines. I developed a system which isn't perfect because each comic strip is counted as '1' (like a whole album).
If I couldn't tell exact/aprox. number of issues with published comics, title was counted as '1' in one year. Sometimes dates were given as aprox. so in such cases I evenly distributed number of comics throughout whole period in which magazine/newspaper existed or particular comic was printed.

*TOOLS*
<br>Everything was calculated and coded in R with ggplot2 package and then enhanced in Adobe Illustrator.

*HOW DID THEY PUBLISH SO MANY COMICS?*
<br>Struzik Franciszek's comic really had over 2000+ issues. It was a daily comic. Yes, just one title.
<br>Christa Janusz was very prolific author of newspaper comics, later he moved into album format.
<br>Walentynowicz Marian also published in newspapers.
<br>Gosława-Lipińska Anna 'Ha-Ga''s cartoons are counted as '52' for each year because according to Wikipedia she published two drawings in each of weekly edition of a magazine.
