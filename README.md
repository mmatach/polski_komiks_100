# Polish comic scene on a 100th Anniversary 
*Polska scena komiksowa na 100-lecie*


First comic was published in 1919. I was interested in how polish comic scene looks right now. How many women are there? How many people actually? 

I'm not able to count everything because some things weren't catalogued.
<br>Counted only things published on paper (so no internet-comics). No single illustration, no covers.
