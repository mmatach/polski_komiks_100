# Polish comic scene on a 100th Anniversary (work in progress)
*Polska scena komiksowa na 100-lecie*


First comic was published in 1919. I was interested in how polish comic scene looks right now. How many women are there? How many people actually? 

<br>Counted only things published on paper (so no internet comics). Also no single illustration(s), no covers.
<br>I'm not able to count everything because some things weren't catalogued. Data before 1990 definitely aren't complete, even old(er) newspaper/magazine comics are not included (i.e. Ha-Ga comics) due to lack of data. I plan to mention about them in an infographic.
<br>Titles published in Świat Młodych are counted as a whole, not how they were published (by 2-3 pages from the chapter in each number of magazine).
